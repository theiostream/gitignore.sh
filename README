gitignore.sh

INSTALL:
git clone git://github.com/theiostream/gitignore.sh.git
cd gitignore
./setup.sh

USAGE:
setup.sh will move gitignore.sh to /usr/bin, so to use the script all 
you need is:

gitignore.sh [OPTION] [PARAMETER]


Currently it makes a directory at ~/Library/, a directory only contained 
on MacOSX. Seemed adequate to me to put it there, although it won't work 
in other Linux distros. Just fork me and fix that issue!
