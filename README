gitignore.sh
Thanks to http://github.com/github/gitignore; All templates are form there.

INSTALL:
git clone git://github.com/theiostream/gitignore.sh.git
cd gitignore.sh
sudo chmod 777 ./setup.sh
./setup.sh

USAGE:
setup.sh will get gitignore.sh ready for you. All you gotta do is to run:

gitignore.sh [OPTION] [PARAMETER]


Currently it makes a directory at ~/Library/, a directory only contained 
on MacOSX. Seemed adequate to me to put it there, although it won't work 
in other Linux distros. Just fork me and fix that issue!

UNINSTALL:
(note that uninstall.sh has NOT been tested, although I doubt bad things can happen...
sudo chmod 777 ./uninstall.sh
sudo ./uninstall.sh
